This was a triumph.
I'm making a note here:
HUGE SUCCESS.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


TODO Items:

1. Include time-waits for missions ran. So if the user choses the moon, it could take 30 seconds (for example) based on the speed of the ship. The user should still be able to interact with the main menu

2. Build out a better shop menu for the user. Should include The option to buy one of 4 ships (the first being dirt cheap and garbage, and the 4th being a high-end one)

3. Color stuff 

4. Delete Debugger lines in user_profile.py
