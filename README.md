Program idea:

New users get small amount of money and a starter ship. 
The user picks a destination to take tourists to for money (moon, mercury, venus, etc)

Expiditions to those destinations give you money, which you can shop for better parts, or better ships

More expeditions give you more rep, which give you more tourists



Czedrik's desires:
- Figuring out a balance of mission distance/money reward/reputation gain vs. ship upgrades and costs.
- Adding a small status report of previous mission's success or failure in main menu to prevent having to scroll all the way back up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------


TODO Items:

1. Include time-waits for missions ran. So if the user choses the moon, it could take 30 seconds (for example) based on the speed of the ship. The user should still be able to interact with the main menu

2. Build out a better shop menu for the user. Should include The option to buy one of 4 ships (the first being dirt cheap and garbage, and the 4th being a high-end one)
